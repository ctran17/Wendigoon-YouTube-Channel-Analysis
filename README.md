Insights:
1. The R-Square of the Linear Regression used in the Python predictive analysis was 0.78, indicating a high goodness of fit yet still having room for context interpretation (special date and time that a video was created, its content's relevance to the channel's target audience, etc.)
2. Based on the current statistics, the predicted average view count of the channel in the next 5 years from now (2025 to 2030) is an upward trend from over 4 million views to almost 7 millions
3. Historically, the top most viewed videos of the channel in a year were uploaded in 1st quarter (January to March) and early 3rd quarter (June-July), and these videos often cover pop culture related topics, popular horror/thriller content, or have keywords such as "Viewers Discretion Advised" or "Content Warning"

Recommendations:
1. The channel could expand into creating Shorts videos that show highlights from either top viewed videos or videos that the channel owner would like to attract more views for, though the former is more advisable since the top viewed videos of the channel have been consistently the same
2. Business partners and sponsors can collaborate more with the YouTube channel either time-wise (around the 1st or early 3rd quarter of the year), or content-wise (videos covering pop culture topics or have keywords that benefit the Search Engine Optimization of the video)
